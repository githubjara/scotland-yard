# Monte Carlo Tree Search for the Scotland Yard board game
This is a Java implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search method for the hide-and-seek board game with imperfect information. Nevertheless, the mcts component is self-contained, domain-independent and can thus be easily reused in other domains. The project was developed for the purpose of my Bachelor’s thesis.
