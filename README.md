# Scotland Yard board game using Monte Carlo Tree Search methods
This is a Java implementation of the hide-and-seek board game with imperfect information - Scotland Yard. The [mcts](https://github.com/nejc92/mcts) component (dependency) is self-contained, domain-independent and can thus be easily reused in other state-action domains. The project was developed for the purpose of my Bachelor’s thesis.
